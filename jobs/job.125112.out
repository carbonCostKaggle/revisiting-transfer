Installing collected packages: pandas
ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

pandas 2.0.0 requires numpy>=1.20.3; python_version < "3.10", but you'll have numpy 1.19.4 which is incompatible.
pandas 2.0.0 requires python-dateutil>=2.8.2, but you'll have python-dateutil 2.8.1 which is incompatible.
